# ImmoSnap

Android app that photographs Belgian "for sale" signs and finds the matching real estate listing on immoweb.be / zimmo.be / immovlan.be.

Point your phone at a `TE KOOP` / `À VENDRE` / `FOR SALE` sign → the app reads the agency name, looks up your location, searches the big Belgian listing sites, and opens the most likely listing in your browser.

## How it works

```
  photo ──► Gemini vision OCR ──► agency name, phone, ref#
                  │
  GPS / EXIF ──► Google Maps geocoding ──► street, city, postal code
                  │
                  ▼
    Gemini 3 Flash + Google Search grounding
                  │
                  ▼
    candidate listing URLs (agency site → immoweb → zimmo → immovlan)
                  │
                  ▼
    scrape og:image + listing photos ──► Gemini vision ranking
                  │
                  ▼
    confidence-ranked matches → open in browser
```

## Build

**Requirements:**
- Android Studio Ladybug+ (or JDK 17+ and Android SDK 35 on the command line)
- 4 API keys (see below)

**Clone and configure:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/merlinfrombelgium/immosnap.git
cd immosnap
cp local.properties.example local.properties
# Edit local.properties and fill in your keys
```

**Build from the command line:**

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
# APK lands in app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

**Or open in Android Studio** and press Run.

## API keys

All four live in `local.properties` (gitignored). The `buildConfigField` wiring in `app/build.gradle.kts` exposes them to the app at compile time.

| Key | Where to get it | Used for |
|-----|-----------------|----------|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | https://aistudio.google.com/apikey | OCR, search grounding, image ranking |
| `MAPS_API_KEY` | Google Cloud Console → Maps APIs | Reverse geocoding (GPS → address) |
| `SEARCH_API_KEY` | *(unused — legacy)* | — |
| `SEARCH_ENGINE_ID` | *(unused — legacy)* | — |

`SEARCH_API_KEY` and `SEARCH_ENGINE_ID` are leftover from the pre-Gemini-grounding Custom Search implementation (see commit `64121eb`). Placeholder values are fine.

## Permissions

At first launch, the app requests:

- `CAMERA` — to photograph the sign
- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` — to geocode the current address
- `ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION` *(Android 10+)* — to read EXIF GPS from gallery photos

Without these, the app shows a "permissions required" screen.

## Using the app

1. **Snap** — full-screen camera; tap the big button to capture a sign (works best when the agency logo and text are clearly readable)
2. **Gallery** — tap the photo icon to pick an existing photo (uses EXIF GPS if present — no device GPS needed)
3. **Processing** — shows the current pipeline stage (reading sign → finding address → searching listings → matching photos)
4. **Result** — top-ranked match opens in the browser; for lower-confidence cases you see the top 3 candidates to pick from

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---------|--------------|
| "No listings found" | Gemini grounding returned nothing for the address. Check the debug card at the bottom of the screen — if OCR got the agency name and the address looks right, the listing may not be publicly indexed. |
| Hangs on "Finding address..." | GPS lock is slow or disabled. Use the gallery picker with a photo that has EXIF GPS instead. |
| Permissions screen never goes away | Force-stop and relaunch the app. |
| Wrong listing as top match | The image-matching stage had poor signal (building photos not scraped, listing site blocks bots). Tap through the top-3 fallback. |

The **debug card** on the result screen shows OCR text, agency name, GPS, resolved address, the Gemini search query, and all candidate URLs with verification status. Use it to diagnose pipeline failures.

## Status

Working proof of concept — builds cleanly, captures photos, runs the full pipeline. Expect rough edges, particularly:

- Gemini can hallucinate listing URLs; the app HEAD-validates them but some fast-listings still slip through
- Image scraping is regex-based and brittle against captcha/JS-rendered listing pages
- No offline mode — every snap needs Gemini + Maps API round-trips
- Debug reporting is best-effort and disabled by default (see `DebugReporter.kt`)
